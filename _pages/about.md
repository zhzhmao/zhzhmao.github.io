Hi! I'm Mao, a student at [WASEDA University](https://www.waseda.jp/top/en/) in the [Graduate School of Information, Production and Systems](https://www.waseda.jp/fsci/gips/en/). I love blue skies and white clouds, that's why my avatar is the way it is.

## My work and research
Currently I am engaged in bioinformatics research, with the target generally being tumors. I focus on genomes and transcriptomes, and in addition to using statistical methods to analyze gene expression, I would like to apply machine learning to the field of cancer. In addition to this, I have found that optimization theory also has applications in the biomedical field and I am learning and understanding this amazing theory. Of course besides dry lab, I am also learning about wet lab, which is equally important.

## My background and history
I am pursuing my master's degree in engineering at Waseda University, and before that I received my bachelor's degree from [Sichuan University](https://en.scu.edu.cn/). During my time in college, I participated in several internships and volunteer activities and led several research and planning efforts.

## My intellectual communities
I am interested in multidisciplinary intersections, and during my undergraduate training, I studied some computer sciences and technologies, after which I moved into the biomedical field and now integrate the fields of information science, oncology and statistics. At the same time, I am also interested in computational intelligence, like neural networks and evolutionary computation. In terms of academic expertise, I spend most of my time in research that utilizes engineering methods to solve biomedical problems. In terms of research methods, both mathematical theory and experimental manipulation are performed, and I will use more statistical analysis methods to contextualize and further support qualitative methods. I am eager to collaborate with people from other disciplines and different backgrounds as I strongly believe that interdisciplinary collaboration is the key to innovation and progress.
