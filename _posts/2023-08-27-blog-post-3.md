# 滕王阁序
## 王勃（唐代）

豫章故郡，洪都新府。星分翼轸，地接衡庐。襟三江而带五湖，控蛮荆而引瓯越。物华天宝，龙光射牛斗之墟；人杰地灵，徐孺下陈蕃之榻。雄州雾列，俊采星驰。台隍枕夷夏之交，宾主尽东南之美。都督阎公之雅望，棨戟遥临；宇文新州之懿范，襜帷暂驻。十旬休假，胜友如云；千里逢迎，高朋满座。腾蛟起凤，孟学士之词宗；紫电青霜，王将军之武库。家君作宰，路出名区；童子何知，躬逢胜饯。

时维九月，序属三秋。潦水尽而寒潭清，烟光凝而暮山紫。俨骖騑于上路，访风景于崇阿。临帝子之长洲，得天人之旧馆。层峦耸翠，上出重霄；飞阁流丹，下临无地。鹤汀凫渚，穷岛屿之萦回；桂殿兰宫，即冈峦之体势。

披绣闼，俯雕甍，山原旷其盈视，川泽纡其骇瞩。闾阎扑地，钟鸣鼎食之家；舸舰弥津，青雀黄龙之舳。云销雨霁，彩彻区明。落霞与孤鹜齐飞，秋水共长天一色。渔舟唱晚，响穷彭蠡之滨，雁阵惊寒，声断衡阳之浦。

遥襟甫畅，逸兴遄飞。爽籁发而清风生，纤歌凝而白云遏。睢园绿竹，气凌彭泽之樽；邺水朱华，光照临川之笔。四美具，二难并。穷睇眄于中天，极娱游于暇日。天高地迥，觉宇宙之无穷；兴尽悲来，识盈虚之有数。望长安于日下，目吴会于云间。地势极而南溟深，天柱高而北辰远。关山难越，谁悲失路之人；萍水相逢，尽是他乡之客。怀帝阍而不见，奉宣室以何年？

嗟乎！时运不齐，命途多舛。冯唐易老，李广难封。屈贾谊于长沙，非无圣主；窜梁鸿于海曲，岂乏明时？所赖君子见机，达人知命。老当益壮，宁移白首之心？穷且益坚，不坠青云之志。酌贪泉而觉爽，处涸辙以犹欢。北海虽赊，扶摇可接；东隅已逝，桑榆非晚。孟尝高洁，空余报国之情；阮籍猖狂，岂效穷途之哭！

勃，三尺微命，一介书生。无路请缨，等终军之弱冠；有怀投笔，慕宗悫之长风。舍簪笏于百龄，奉晨昏于万里。非谢家之宝树，接孟氏之芳邻。他日趋庭，叨陪鲤对；今兹捧袂，喜托龙门。杨意不逢，抚凌云而自惜；钟期既遇，奏流水以何惭？

呜呼！胜地不常，盛筵难再；兰亭已矣，梓泽丘墟。临别赠言，幸承恩于伟饯；登高作赋，是所望于群公。敢竭鄙怀，恭疏短引；一言均赋，四韵俱成。请洒潘江，各倾陆海云尔：

- 滕王高阁临江渚，佩玉鸣鸾罢歌舞。
- 画栋朝飞南浦云，珠帘暮卷西山雨。
- 闲云潭影日悠悠，物换星移几度秋。
- 阁中帝子今何在？槛外长江空自流。

# Preface to the Pavilion of Prince Teng
## Wang, Bo (Tang dynasty)

Behold, the ancient city of Yuzhang in the Han Dynasty, now the seat of the Commandery of Hongzhou. In the celestial realm, it claims dominion between the constellations Yi and Zhen. Below, it lies nestled amid the splendor of Mount Heng and Mount Lu. Like a majestic garment, it is adorned with the Three Rivers and cinched with Five Lakes, commanding the heart of Chu and bridging the realms of Min and Yue. Its treasures rival those bestowed by the heavens, a brilliance surpassing the stars themselves. Its terrain breathes an exquisite air of elegance, where Chen Fan set several resting places for his friend Xu Ru. Structures within Hongzhou are arranged like clouds and mists, while talents traverse its streets like shooting stars. This city, situated at the confluence of Central Plains and the Southern Tribes, embraces both distinguished guests and hosts, gathering the finest souls of the southeast. Commander Yan, acclaimed and revered, graces Hongzhou's realm, his noble name resounding far and wide. Governor Yuwen, a paragon of virtue, paused here on his journey, exemplifying nobility in transit. Decadally, the rendezvous of the fortnight welcomes numerous kindred spirits, a gathering of exalted companions filling the seats. Master Meng's written artistry soars like an ascending dragon, akin to the dance of a resplendent phoenix. Within General Wang's arsenal, weapons gleam as sharp as violet lightning and blue frost. By virtue of my father's tenure in Jiuzhen, I had the privilege of passing through this renowned place en route to kin. In my youth, unknowing, I found myself fortunate to partake in this grand celebration.

Amidst deep autumn's September, rainwaters had receded, the chill in the waters subsided. Crystalline skies cradled wisps of cloud and twilight draped mountains in hues of purple. On high mountain roads, horse-drawn carriages traversed lofty ranges in pursuit of scenic wonders. Within Changzhou of yore, abodes of celestial beings were found. Verdant peaks pierced the heavens in overlapping layers, while ethereal pavilions and scarlet pathways seemed to float among the skies, concealing the earth below. Waterside flats and islets served as abodes for cranes and wild ducks, mimicking the meandering grace of archipelagos. Grand palaces adorned the undulating hills, woven into the landscape.

Pushing open intricately carved gates, gazing upon decorative roofs, landscapes of peaks and plains unfurled before my eyes. Abodes and residences filled every lane, as wealthy households resounded with the chime of bells and the clinking of bronzeware. Ferries crowded the docks, great vessels adorned with patterns of blue sparrows and yellow dragons. As clouds dispersed and rain ceased, sunlight bathed the landscape, clear skies above. Hues of twilight and solitary birds took flight, merging autumn's river with the boundless sky in seamless unity. Evening witnessed fishermen's songs echoing on boats, their melodies resounding along the shores of Penglai Lake. In autumn's grasp, geese sensed the chill, their cries resounding by the waters of Hengyang.

A panoramic vista invoked a sense of liberation, igniting soaring spirits. The sounds of reed pipes beckoned gentle breezes, mellifluous songs enticed drifting white clouds. This grand celebration today, akin to Liangyuan's refined gathering, surpassed even the capacity for drink of Tao Yuanming. Scholarly guests, akin to Cao Zhi of yore, wove verses as resplendent as "Red Blooms Out of a Green Pool," their literary grace reminiscent of Xie Lingyun's pen. Music, food, discourse, and verse – these four cherished facets converged, their noble hosts and esteemed guests united. Gazing skyward, we reveled on this holiday. The vast sky, boundless land, embodied the universe's infinity. Revelry departed, melancholy settled, realizing the inevitability of all things' waxing and waning. Gazing west, the setting sun casting Chang'an into shadows, Wu's domain emerged amidst mist and clouds. Geographical remoteness, Southern Sea's profound depths, Kunlun's peak touching the heavens – constellations at the North Star's apex – with mountain ranges and myriad islands abounding. Over rugged passes difficult to traverse, who could empathize with my unfulfilled aspirations? Chance meetings welcomed guests from afar, filling seats with wanderers from foreign lands. Pining for the emperor's palace, yet unsummoned – when might I serve the court like Jia Yi in Xuan?

Ah, fortunes of men differ, life's destinies often obstinate. Feng Tang aged with ease, while Li Guang achieved countless victories yet noble titles eluded him. Jia Yi, endowed with talent, found himself in Changsha's shadow – not for want of wise rulers, nor in a time of enlightenment. It is the sagacious who understand timing, the discerning who apprehend destiny. Though years advance, spirit endures; how can one alter one's demeanor in old age? Amid adversity, resolve strengthens, never forsaking lofty aspirations. Even after drinking from the Spring of Greed, no avarice emerged; as a carp in a dwindling rut, it remained content. Though distant, the North Sea was reachable on a strong wind; the sunrise might have faded, but cherishing twilight remained timely. Meng Chang used a noble heart to fortify himself; then, why lament fate in straits, like Ruan Ji's tears?

Humble is my status, a mere scholar. Though age peers with Zhong Jun, opportunities for service to country remain distant. Like Ban Chao, that fervor for military service burns; like Zong Que's "Riding Wind, Breaking Waves" aspiration, to journey far and wide. Abandoning prospects for glory, I journey great distances to attend my father. Though not on par with Xie Xuan's brilliance, I mingle with many virtuous and learned individuals. Soon, I will join my father, learning from him like Kong Li did from his father; today's reception by Commandant Yan leaves me as elated as ascending Longmen. If not for an introduction like Yang Deyi's, I must console myself by patting my own works. Having encountered Zhong Ziqi, playing "Flowing Water," why feel ashamed?

Ah, ephemeral are famed locales, grand feasts rare to relive. Orchid Pavilion's illustrious gatherings have become history, Shichong's Zize reduced to ruins. Honored with the grace of this feast, I pen this preface upon departure, leaving the exalted verses to be composed by those present. I, daring to express my meager sentiments, have crafted this brief foreword. A four-line quatrain has also been penned. Let each of you, like Pan Yue and Lu Ji, exhibit literary prowess akin to traversing the rivers and oceans:

- Majestic Pavilion of Prince Teng stands tall, overlooking the sandy islet in the river's heart; yet the opulent song and dance of yore, with jade and phoenix bells, have ceased.
- At dawn, Southern Wharf's light clouds skim the pavilion's eaves; at twilight, Western Mountain's mist and rain roll up the pavilion's beaded curtains.
- Leisurely shadows of colorful clouds mirror in the river, drifting through the day; as fleeting as time itself, how many springs and autumns have passed?
- The prince Teng who once savored lofty heights, where might he be now? Only the relentless river beyond the balustrade flows ceaselessly toward distant realms.
