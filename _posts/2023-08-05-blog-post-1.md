## Lyrics
Амыран  

Кӱреҥ кӱстиҥ ӧйинде,  
Аҥдап јортым тайгага.  
Сыгын айдын салкыны,  
Сыылап турды таскылда.  
 
Агын сууда сары бӱр,  
Агып јадат учы јок.  
Сыгын айдыҥ салкыны,  
Сыылап турды таскылда.  

## Lyrics in English:  
Amyran  

In the brown autumn season,  
Riding and shooting in the great forest.  
Singing a tune in the gentle moonlight breeze,  
A tribute to the homeland.  

Layered yellow leaves like streams,  
Flowing endlessly as they overturn.  
Singing a tune in the gentle moonlight breeze,  
A tribute to the homeland.
